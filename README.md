Definitely a must read for all peeps into statistical learning .
It's going to be a long long task since I only take an introductory statistics courses in this semester and then I don't know when I can continue with a datascience statistics course (after Inference) but we'll see. I'll try my best to keep it updated. And yeah, the notes are 100% TEX Based though I would add some jupyter notebooks in the repository.
